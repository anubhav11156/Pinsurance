*PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Pinsurance is a peer-to-peer blockchain-based Defi platform for car insurance.  User can create insurance pools with their peers and pool their premiums in it. Once all peers have contributed the pool is active and users can make claim requests. 
Every created insurance policy is an NFT (ERC-721 Token).
